            Hello everyone! my name is Rodrigo, also known as Rod, Roddy and since I was born, 
            Pichi (pronounced Peachy), so feel free to call me anyway, 
            I know Rodrigo is too long and rolling the ‘r’ is not easy to everyone.
        </p>  
        <p class="text4">
            I am from Guatemala and came to NZ in 2011and got my citizenship last year (yay!!!), 
            all this time in NZ I’ve been living in Auckland.
        </p>
        <p class="text4">
            In term of values, I consider myself to be loyal, honest and empathetic;  
            I’m able to place myself in other people’s place and try to see things 
            their perspective; as my identity, well… I have a good sense of humor, 
            I like to take things easy and enjoy the moment, also I have an extremely 
            sweet tooth (don’t test me, you will loose!!!).
        </p>
        <p class="text4">
            I’m in Dev Academy because, well… due to covid I lost my job as flight attendant 
            and saw myself looking for a new career, I have had self taught a little bit of 
            coding years ago (I forgot most of it), and I knew I like it, so why not going 
            the whole nine yards, right?
