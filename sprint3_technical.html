    <h2 class='title'>HTML and CSS</em></h2>
    <p class='text3'>
        The difference between html and css is absolutely everything, 
        they actually complement each other, I like to think that html
         is like a house without absolutely any type of 'finishing', 
         a house as it is built, columns, beams, walls and roof, 
         but then come CSS and I think of css as absolutely everything 
         that styles that house, colour and texture on the walls, the 
         type of floor that the house will have, the type of lamps, 
         the texture, if it will have curtains or blinds... or both, 
         which kind of taps and switches will it have... absolutely 
         everything that we see that makes the house 'pritier' or 'stylish'.  
         The same way I imagine that html and css work, together in order 
         to display the website, html is the structure, the base and 
         foundations of the website, while css is all the styling that 
         we see in each website.

    <h2 class='title'>control flow and loops</em></h2>

    <p class='text3'>
        Control flow is the order in which a code is interpreted in order to execute it. 
        It generally is line by line, unless it comes across an instruction to go look 
        back again, which in this case would be a 'loop', to put it in an example: 
        let's say that we are at the supermarket and we have a list of articles to buy, 
        so we enter the supermarket and go and pick what we need, and we do so by 
        walking one isle at a time, and when we reach the end and we check our list 
        we find that we have everything that we need, then we go and proceed to the 
        checkout; but if at that point, we don't have everything that we need, then 
        in that case we go back to the isle where we need to get the  article that 
        we're missing. So the same way is the control flow and loops in javascript 
        in our code; the variables are the objects in our list, the control flow 
        is out path in order to get them and the loops when/if we need to go back 
        to get the rest of the articles that we're missing.
    </p><br/></br/>

    <h2 class='title'>the DOM</em></h2>

    <p class='text3'>
        D - document<br>
        O - object<br>
        M - model<br>
    </p><br/>

    <p class='text3'>
        The way that I understand it, the DOM is the magic that happens 'behind curtains' 
        on a website, it usually is represented as a tree, with all the branches coming out 
        from a single element, where every element is called a 'node', and each element has
        properties.  Now the DOM, being considered an 'object oriented' it means that...  
        as an analogy let's think of an car as a whole, if it would not be an object 
        oriented and we want to make a change on the car, let it be the colour, or the
        seats or the engine, we would have to start from scratch again to design the
        whole car with the change that we want, but by being 'object oriented' we can 
        work on every single 'object' that we want to change or modify. So if we want 
        to change or modify any part of the car, we can grab that element and change 
        or modify it without having to start the whole car from scratch. The same way 
        an object oriented language works, we can modify every single one of the 
        elements (or nodes) and their attributes, and the way that we can do that is 
        through the DOM,. To put it other words, html sends informations to the DOM 
        and on the other side there is a programming language like javascript which 
        interacts with the DOM as an API for the html so the DOM grabs both html & 
        (in this case) javascript, interprets both of them and what we end up looking 
        on the screen is based on the DOM and not based on the html code.  
    </p><br/></br/>
    

    <h2 class='title'>accessing data from arrays and objects</em></h2>


    <h3 class='subtitle'>objects</em></h2>
    <p class='text3'>
        We use 'objects' to represent a thing in our code. It can be anything, 
        a person, and actual object,  a book, etc. anything that we want, so 
        like any object/person/year/book... they all have characteristics that 
        differentiate one from each other and these characteristics are known as 
        'properties' in javascript.<br>
        These properties can be either: access, added, changer or removed; 
        and the way that we do that is with a dot '.' or a bracket '[]'.<br><br>
        dot = object.property <br>
        bracket = object['property']<br><br> 
        person.age and pergon['age'] both entries would return the age of 'person',
        and so we can add, remove or change properties of an object.
    </p><br/>
    

    <h3 class='subtitle'>arrays</em></h2>

    <p class='text3'>
        We use 'arrays' when we want to create a list of different items in one variable. 
        It is important to mention that arrays have a zero base index, which means that 
        when accessing a list of items in an array, we will do with their position inside 
        the array, so for arrays, the number 0 is the first item on the list, therefore, 
        if we have 3 items and we want the first one of the list, that would be the number 0.<br><br>
        example:<br>
        var colours = ['red', 'blue', 'yellow', 'green'];<br>
        so if we want to call on the first item, we will do so by calling the number 0:<br>
        colour[0]  (will return the colour 'red')<br><br>
        Just like properties in an object, the items inside an array can also be added, removed, change. <br><br><br>
        So the main difference when accessing data between objects and arrays is that when we call 
        the property of the object, we will do so calling directly this property, but in an array, by 
        being able to hold a large list of items, we can do so by number in their index.<br><br>
    </p><br/>
   

    <h2 class='title'>functions in javascript</em></h2>

    <p class='text3'>
        Functions are used to perform specific tasks and it is what gives the 
        interactivity to our websites or apps, we also use it to perform certain 
        actions to help us to retrieve data.  One of the best things about 
        functions is that with these we can write a more efficient code, 
        instead of writing the same piece of code over and over, we can 
        instead write a function that will save us from writing such piece of 
        code over and over, which ultimately will make our code easier to 
        read and easier to maintain.<br>
