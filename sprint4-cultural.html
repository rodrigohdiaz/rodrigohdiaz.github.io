    <h1 class='title'>neuroplasticity and growth mindset</h1>
    
    <h2 class='title'>neuroplasticity</h2>
    
    <p class='text3'>
        Neuroplasticity is the ability that our brains have to ‘re-wire’ themselves. 
        This a way that our brains adapt to new experiences, knowledge, etc.  It has been
         proved recently that our brains keep changing due to our learning, by learning we 
         create connections between neurones, and with these connections, our brain is 
         ‘re-shaped’ or commonly known as ‘re-wired’. The best way to create strong connections 
         between neutrons is by repetition, by repeating exercises or experiences, we create 
         strong connections and by doing so, we change our brain.
        <br/></br/>
    

        There are 2 types of neuroplasticity:
        <ul class='text3 list'>
            <li>Structural neuroplasticity: in which the strength of the connections between neurons changes.</li>
            <li>Functional neuroplasticity, which describes the permanent changes in synapses due to learning and development.</li>
        </ul><br><br>
    </p>

    <p class='text3'>
        Both types have exciting potential, but structural neuroplasticity is probably the one that is more 
        attended to at the moment; we already know that some functions can be rerouted, relearned, and 
        re-established in the brain, but changes to the actual structure of the brain are where many of the 
        exciting possibilities lie.<br><br><br>

    <h2 class='title'>how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h2>

    <p class='text3'>
        When people understand the ability of the brain to adapt and create stronger connections
        between its neurones, then people will be able to exploit this ability of the bran to be 
        able to perform better in their lives, as an example here are some of the ways that neuroplasticity 
        benefits people’s lives:
        </br/>

    <ol class='text3 list'>
        <li>Recovery from brain events like strokes;</li>
        <li>Recovery from traumatic brain injuries;</li>
        <li>Ability to rewire functions in the brain (e.g., if an area that controls one sense is damaged, other areas may be able to pick up the slack);</li>
        <li>Losing function in one area may enhance functions in other areas (e.g., if one sense is lost, the others may become heightened);</li>
        <li>Enhanced memory abilities;</li>
        <li>Wide range of enhanced cognitive abilities;</li>
        <li>More effective learning.</li>
    </ol><br><br><br>

    </p>

    <h2 class='title'>how one can engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for one's own benefit?</h2>

    <p class='text3'>
        I see that one way to re-wire the brain with neuruplasticity is with repetition, so I can see that 
        by doing exercises and practicing code, I’ll be able to re-wire my brain into coding, and not being 
        a spring chicken anymore, I see that this is a great way to help improve not only my learning path, 
        but also my health and well being.<br>
    </p>

    <p class='text3'>
        This is some of the ways that neuroplasticity can be applied.<br>
        A few of the methods that have been shown to enhance or boost neuroplasticity include:
    </p><br/></br/>

    <ul class='text3 list'>
        <li>Intermittent fasting: increases synaptic adaptation, promotes neuron growth, improve overall cognitive function, and decreases the risk of neurodegenerative disease;</li>
        <li>Traveling: exposes your brain to novel stimuli and new environments, opening up new pathways and activity in the brain;</li>
        <li>Using mnemonic devices: memory training can enhance connectivity in the prefrontal parietal network and prevent some age-related memory loss;</li>
        <li>Learning a musical instrument: may increase connectivity between brain regions and help form new neural networks;</li>
        <li>Non-dominant hand exercises: can form new neural pathways and strengthen the connectivity between neurons;</li>
        <li>Reading fiction: increases and enhances connectivity in the brain;</li>
        <li>Expanding your vocabulary: activates the visual and auditory processes as well as memory processing;</li>
        <li>Creating artwork: enhances the connectivity of the brain at rest, which can boost introspection, memory, empathy, attention, and focus;</li>
        <li>Dancing: reduces the risk of Alzheimer’s and increases neural connectivity;</li>
        <li>Sleeping: encourages learning retention through the growth of the dendritic spines that act as connections between neurons and help transfer information across cells.</li>
    </ul><br><br>

    <h2 class='title'>Some ways to improve my neuroplasticity</h2>


    <p class='text3'>
        As mentioned before, some ways that I can use to improve my neuroplasticity are: by repeating exercises, 
        and doing some extra activities, like intermittent fasting, reading fiction, sometimes trying some 
        exercises with my non dominant hand, going for a wee boogie and of course, sleeping!

    <h2 class='title'>growth mindset</h2>

    <h2 class='title'>what is it and why it is relevant</h2>

    <p class='text3'>
        Mindset is divided in two: <strong>fixed</strong> and <strong>growth</strong>;<br><br>
        <strong>Fixed</strong> mindset is the way that people perceive everything, 
        they think that a person is born with their intelligence and that that intelligence can’t be improved, 
        see different problems as obstacles and constantly look for the ‘easy solutions’.<br><br> 
        <strong>Growth</strong> mindset is a 
        more flexible one, is the way that we see things in a way that are going to be good for us, a growth 
        mindset sees a problem as a challenge, understands that one can achieve anything one wants and that our 
        intelligence can be improved, we can learn new things all our life.<br>
    </p><br/>

    <p class='text3'>A growth mindset goes hand in hand with neuroplasticity, as in once a person realises 
        that our brains can adapt and improve over time, then we will stop seeing problems but challenges, 
        a failure becomes a new way to find the wrong answer,  and it is only with time and work that we will be 
        able to be where we want to be.<br><br><br><br>
    </p>
   

    <h2 class='title'>how will I integrate growth mindset into my learning journey?</h2>

    <p class='text3'>
        With challenges, I know I probably will have a hard time solving them, but I know now 
        that these won’t be imposible and so I will need to practice as much as I’ll be able, 
        and repeat and repeat them; try to solve different challenges in different ways; I know 
        that it will be hard, but I know that anyone can do it. I know now also about neuroplasticity
         and how my brain will eventually adapt  and eventually see these challenges not so hard, 
         and then I’ll be able to look into harder challenges and so on.  And whenever I feel that 
         I can’t do something, I’ll remember something that I heard someone saying at the gym: 
         “don’t believe the lies that your brain is telling you”;  I know, I know, sounds ironic 
         based on what we have discussed up to this point, but I do believe that it is our 
         ‘fixed mindset’ brain the one that tells us that we can’t solve this or that, that we can’t
          do one more push up… that we can’t! so stop listening to this ‘lie’ and start to achieve!<br><br>
