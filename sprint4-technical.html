    <h2 class='title'>the time that I got blocked on a simple problem</em></h2>
    <p class='text3'>
        Actually on my last post on this blog; it was a simple problem but 
        I couldn't find the words, I got mentally blocked and just hit a wall, 
        time was ticking and needed to write it!
    </p><br/>

    <p class='text3'>
        In order to solve it I actually used the rubber duck method, in this 
        case I spoke to my dog about it, I immediately didn't think I was using 
        that method, I was just rambling about finding the words and while doing that, 
        the words came to me, so I started writing.  It was then that I noticed that 
        I have used this method before and do it often.  It made me feel really good 
        as this was the first time that I notice that I use this method.  I learn that 
        sometimes I just need to express my ideas out loud and also that sometimes I 
        just need to write.

    <h2 class='title'>the time I solved a problem in an elegant way</em></h2>

        So there was also the time when I designed a piece of furniture for 
        my living room.  There was a bookshelf and a tv stand, but then swap 
        the old tv for a flat screen, needless to say that nothing look good 
        with that change, so I decided that I needed new furniture to make everything 
        look better, so I sat down and wrote what I wanted: "the bookshelf to be 
        integrated with the tv stand" something that look simple enough, this case 
        I used the 'pseudocode' with a slight twist, I did a couple of sketches, 
        so next step went to the hardware store and got what I needed, that night 
        I sat down and enjoy a nice evening watching tv... my new tv with my 'own designed' 
        bookshelf/tv furniture.  This time I learned that I can do what I set my mind into.  
        (after 5 years I still have this piece of furniture... there's no glue, no nails or no screws!)

    <h2 class='title'>reflection on problem solving techniques</em></h2>

    <p class='text3'>
        I have noticed in the last couple of weeks that I do tend to utilise 
        more of these methods than I expected, google is probably the most common, 
        although it is important to know what to search and how to search for it.  
        I tend to also express myself out loud (the rubber duck method), but this 
        I only tend to do it when I'm alone or if I'm speaking with a person that 
        is in the room about it. The pseudocode is another method that I tend to 
        use a lot, I use it to clear my head and help me get a clearer idea of what 
        needs to be done, sometimes I don't need to write about the problem but to 
        draw a graph or a sketch, anything to help me visualise the problem in order 
        to be able to solve it.  I do, however tend to be a bit shy when it comes to 
        look to a classmate or facilitator when I have a problem, I have realised that 
        I am a bit stubborn like that and want to find the answer by myself, I need to 
        learn to ask for help when I need it.
