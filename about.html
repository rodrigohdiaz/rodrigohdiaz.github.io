      Born and raised in Guatemala, now a NZ citizen; I have been living in Auckland
      since 2011.
      <br />
      <br /> 
      My diverse jobs have ranged from flight attendant, hospitality, labourer, security 
      for an international airline, planning technician, draughts person, 
      design consultant and architect to get me where I am now. Each of 
      these have given me different experience, all of which is valuable 
      in different situations in any work and try to bring this experience to any
      situation in my life.
      <br />
      <br />My passions include photography (35mm/120mm film and digital) my favourite
      type of photography being street photography, but I capture a moment or a detail, 
      a closeup or a panorama, in black and white or colour; I like video games and read.
      And occasionally I write, sometimes nonsense and sometimes 
      deeply thoughtful â€“ or at least I think so.
