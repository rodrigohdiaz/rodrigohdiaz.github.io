    <h1 class='title'>FOUNDATIONS CORE SKILLS</h1>
    
    <h3 class='subtitle'>what are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h2>
    
    <p class='text3'>
        - I have learn that the only way to work around a problem when I feel that I’m stuck, 
        is to keep trying, look for a different approach, a different way to see things in order 
        to solve them in a different way than I previously thought I was going to do it.<br><br>
        - I can overcome procrastination if I’m aware of the times I’m putting into what 
        I’m doing, if I account myself for the time I’m working I can then turn around and be 
        more productive.<br><br>
        - I have learn that there is a big difference in listening a person just to wait for 
        what I want to say and listening really paying attention about what this person is 
        saying and soak in the information they are saying. 
         
    </p><br><br>

    <h3 class='subtitle'>what are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h2>

    <p class='text3'>
        That we are programming with other people and for other people; today we can start 
        writing our own code and someone else in the future will work on this code we just 
        wrote; next time we can be working on the code that someone else wrote; we can be 
        working at some times as part of a team and other times by ourselves.  The importance 
        of these roles in learning and programming is then because we work with other people 
        in many different ways.
        
    </p></br><br>

    <h3 class='subtitle'>what has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>

    <p class='text3'>
        That I have much to learn from each person that I’m working with but also 
        that there is still a lot to learn about myself.
    </p><br><br>

   

    <h3 class='subtitle'>what were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>


    <p class='text3'>
        To leave pride on a side, I might have not the best approach to a problem 
        and when someone else comes and points out what I’m doing wrong, or what I 
        need to improve, to take that as a learning point instead of being proud 
        and be defensive about some other’s opinion about my work.
    </p><br><br>
    
   
    <h3 class='subtitle'>why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h2>


    <p class='text3'>
        Because with this core learning, we learn to listen and work together, which for 
        bootcamp is going to be fundamental, and more even, it helps us to work good as 
        part of a team and then when we’re applying for a job, we will be sure that we 
        can work as part of a team where we can not only work but also to collaborate in 
        an efficient way.
    </p><br><br>
   

    <h3 class='subtitle'>does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? </h2>

    <p class='text3'>
        I don’t think it is a waste of time, it has been helping me to understand many 
        things about how I learn and how I can approach different situations and problems 
        and the best way for me to solve them or to look for a way to solve them.
    </p><br><br><br>

    <h3 class='subtitle'>what is your long term goal and career pathway?</h2>


        <p class='text3'>
            I am here because I am looking to get into a development job,  
            I wanted a career change for a while and for obvious circumstances this year, 
            I had to do it sooner than expected.
        </p><br><br>


    <h3 class='subtitle'>what do you think your biggest strenths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h2>

        <p class='text3'>
            One of my biggest strengths during Bootcamp will be that I'm easy going and
            one of my biggest limitations will be that sometimes I do have a lack of confidence
            in what I can do.
        </p><br><br>

    <h3 class='subtitle'>what do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Boocamp will be?</h2>

        <p class='text3'>
            To have faith in myself!
        </p><br><br>

    <h3 class='subtitle'>what non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h2>

        <p class='text3'>
            To be able to feel confidence in giving my point of view when it is needed to, ofter
            I see myself not saying anything, even when I know it would be the right thing to do,
            but because I don't feel confident that it actually is the best thing to do, I keep 
            quiet until I'm asked, if I'm asked.
        </p><br><br>

    <h3 class='subtitle'>what are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h2>

        <p class='text3'>
            That I will have the ability to be able to learn any programming language that I'd want.
