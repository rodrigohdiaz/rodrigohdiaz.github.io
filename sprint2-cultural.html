        <p class="text4">
            My long term goal is to get a job where I can build a career, 
            where I can be able to work from home or office, or a cafe down the road.
        </p>  
        <p class="text4">
            To be able to work under pressure while working under a deadline and being able to to the job properly.
        </p>
        <p class="text4">
            My strengths are that I'm loyal, honest and empathetic;  
            I’m able to place myself in other people’s place and try to 
            see things their perspective; I have a good sense of humour, 
            I'm good working in teams as much as by myself. 
            As my limitations,  I sometimes doubt myself and need some 
            sort of reassurance that what I'm doing is right.
        </p>
        <p class="text4">
            In order for me to work productively, I'm working on getting used to the 'timebox', 
            and also by using 'toggl' I am more aware that 'the time is running' and this helps 
            me focus and stop me from procrastinating; I'm building a routine around my study 
            times and this allows me to have time walk my dog and use this time to reflect 
            on what I have learn.
        </p>

        <p class="text4">
            Whenever I need help, I will use 'slack' to ask a question, depending on the case, 
            either directly to my facilitator or to other learners, as well as if I see that 
            someone needs help and it is in my possibilities, I also would help others this same way.
        </p>

        <p class="text4">
            To point me in the right direction if I need some correction. 
            I also would expect them to give me real world examples from their experiences.
